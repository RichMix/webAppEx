[ 1"; SELECT * FROM USERS WHERE "%"=" ]
- The 1"; terminates the SQL statement that the server is attempting to execute.
- The SELECT * FROM USERS WHERE starts a second SQL statement which will grab all the fields from the users table.
- The "%"=" matches the end of the SQL statement that is added after the query. 

Refer to the fact that %"; was being added to the end of the input submitted by the search bar. The net result of the two parts combined is 
[ "%"=" ] 
[ %"; ]
[ "%"=" ]  
[ %"; ]
â€‹
which will cause the WHERE to be true for every row in the table.
