 be displayed in the message is http://www.moviescope.com/party_pics. Click OK.

24 -27. The victim will be prompted to enter their username and password into the form fields, which appear as on the genuine website. When
 the victim enters the Username and Password and clicks Login, they will be redirected to the legitimate MovieScope login page. Note the
 different URLs in the browser address bar for the cloned and real sites.

 used by the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the victim’s account.
30. Scroll down to find Username and Password displayed in the terminal.
