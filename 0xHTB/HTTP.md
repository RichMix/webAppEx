# HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

Today, the majority of the applications we use constantly interact with the internet, both web and mobile applications. Most internet communications are made with web requests through the HTTP protocol. 
HTTP is an application-level protocol used to access the World Wide Web resources. The term hypertext stands for text containing links to other resources and text that the readers can easily interpret.

HTTP communication consists of a client and a server, where the client requests the server for a resource. The server processes the requests and returns the requested resource. 
The default port for HTTP communication is port 80, though this can be changed to any other port, depending on the web server configuration. The same requests are utilized when we use the internet to visit different websites. 
We enter a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) as a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) to reach the desired website, like www.hackthebox.com.

Here is what each component stands for:

Component	Example	Description

- Scheme	http:// https://	This is used to identify the protocol being accessed by the client, and ends with a colon and a double slash (://)
- User Info	admin:password@	This is an optional component that contains the credentials (separated by a colon :) used to authenticate to the host, and is separated from the host with an at sign (@)
- Host	inlanefreight.com	The host signifies the resource location. This can be a hostname or an IP address
- Port	:80	The Port is separated from the Host by a colon (:). If no port is specified, http schemes default to port 80 and https default to port 443
- Path	/dashboard.php	This points to the resource being accessed, which can be a file or a folder. If there is no path specified, the server returns the default index (e.g. index.html).
- Query String	?login=true	The query string starts with a question mark (?), and consists of a parameter (e.g. login) and a value (e.g. true). Multiple parameters can be separated by an ampersand (&).
- Fragments	#status	Fragments are processed by the browsers on the client-side to locate sections within the primary resource (e.g. a header or section on the page).

Not all components are required to access a resource. 
The main mandatory fields are the scheme and the host, without which the request would have no resource to request.

## HTTP Headers
We have seen examples of HTTP requests and response headers in the previous section. Such HTTP headers pass information between the client and the server. Some headers are only used with either requests or responses, while some other general headers are common to both.

Headers can have one or multiple values, appended after the header name and separated by a colon. We can divide headers into the following categories:

General Headers
Entity Headers
Request Headers
Response Headers
Security Headers
Let's discuss each of these categories.

General Headers
General headers are used in both HTTP requests and responses. They are contextual and are used to describe the message rather than its contents.

Header	Example	Description
Date	Date: Wed, 16 Feb 2022 10:38:44 GMT	Holds the date and time at which the message originated. It's preferred to convert the time to the standard UTC time zone.
Connection	Connection: close	Dictates if the current network connection should stay alive after the request finishes. Two commonly used values for this header are close and keep-alive. The close value from either the client or server means that they would like to terminate the connection, while the keep-alive header indicates that the connection should remain open to receive more data and input.
Entity Headers
Similar to general headers, Entity Headers can be common to both the request and response. These headers are used to describe the content (entity) transferred by a message. They are usually found in responses and POST or PUT requests.

Header	Example	Description
Content-Type	Content-Type: text/html	Used to describe the type of resource being transferred. The value is automatically added by the browsers on the client-side and returned in the server response. The charset field denotes the encoding standard, such as UTF-8.
Media-Type	Media-Type: application/pdf	The media-type is similar to Content-Type, and describes the data being transferred. This header can play a crucial role in making the server interpret our input. The charset field may also be used with this header.
Boundary	boundary="b4e4fbd93540"	Acts as a marker to separate content when there is more than one in the same message. For example, within a form data, this boundary gets used as --b4e4fbd93540 to separate different parts of the form.
Content-Length	Content-Length: 385	Holds the size of the entity being passed. This header is necessary as the server uses it to read data from the message body, and is automatically generated by the browser and tools like cURL.
Content-Encoding	Content-Encoding: gzip	Data can undergo multiple transformations before being passed. For example, large amounts of data can be compressed to reduce the message size. The type of encoding being used should be specified using the Content-Encoding header.
Request Headers
The client sends Request Headers in an HTTP transaction. These headers are used in an HTTP request and do not relate to the content of the message. The following headers are commonly seen in HTTP requests.

Header	Example	Description
Host	Host: www.inlanefreight.com	Used to specify the host being queried for the resource. This can be a domain name or an IP address. HTTP servers can be configured to host different websites, which are revealed based on the hostname. This makes the host header an important enumeration target, as it can indicate the existence of other hosts on the target server.
User-Agent	User-Agent: curl/7.77.0	The User-Agent header is used to describe the client requesting resources. This header can reveal a lot about the client, such as the browser, its version, and the operating system.
Referer	Referer: http://www.inlanefreight.com/	Denotes where the current request is coming from. For example, clicking a link from Google search results would make https://google.com the referer. Trusting this header can be dangerous as it can be easily manipulated, leading to unintended consequences.
Accept	Accept: */*	The Accept header describes which media types the client can understand. It can contain multiple media types separated by commas. The */* value signifies that all media types are accepted.
Cookie	Cookie: PHPSESSID=b4e4fbd93540	Contains cookie-value pairs in the format name=value. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the client-side and on the server, which acts as an identifier. These are passed to the server per request, thus maintaining the client's access. Cookies can also serve other purposes, such as saving user preferences or session tracking. There can be multiple cookies in a single header separated by a semi-colon.
Authorization	Authorization: BASIC cGFzc3dvcmQK	Another method for the server to identify clients. After successful authentication, the server returns a token unique to the client. Unlike cookies, tokens are stored only on the client-side and retrieved by the server per request. There are multiple types of authentication types based on the webserver and application type used.
A complete list of request headers and their usage can be found here.

Response Headers
Response Headers can be used in an HTTP response and do not relate to the content. Certain response headers such as Age, Location, and Server are used to provide more context about the response. The following headers are commonly seen in HTTP responses.

Header	Example	Description
Server	Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)	Contains information about the HTTP server, which processed the request. It can be used to gain information about the server, such as its version, and enumerate it further.
Set-Cookie	Set-Cookie: PHPSESSID=b4e4fbd93540	Contains the cookies needed for client identification. Browsers parse the cookies and store them for future requests. This header follows the same format as the Cookie request header.
WWW-Authenticate	WWW-Authenticate: BASIC realm="localhost"	Notifies the client about the type of authentication required to access the requested resource.
Security Headers
Finally, we have Security Headers. With the increase in the variety of browsers and web-based attacks, defining certain headers that enhanced security was necessary. HTTP Security headers are a class of response headers used to specify certain rules and policies to be followed by the browser while accessing the website.

Header	Example	Description
Content-Security-Policy	Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self'	Dictates the website's policy towards externally injected resources. This could be JavaScript code as well as script resources. This header instructs the browser to accept resources only from certain trusted domains, hence preventing attacks such as Cross-site scripting (XSS).
Strict-Transport-Security	Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000	Prevents the browser from accessing the website over the plaintext HTTP protocol, and forces all communication to be carried over the secure HTTPS protocol. This prevents attackers from sniffing web traffic and accessing protected information such as passwords or other sensitive data.
Referrer-Policy	Referrer-Policy: origin	Dictates whether the browser should include the value specified via the Referer header or not. It can help in avoiding disclosing sensitive URLs and information while browsing the website.
Note: This section only mentions a small subset of commonly seen HTTP headers. There are many other contextual headers that can be used in HTTP communications. 
]It's also possible for applications to define custom headers based on their requirements. A complete list of standard HTTP headers can be found here.
 
# - THM -

- HTTP messages are packets of data exchanged between a user (the client) and the web server. These messages are very important for understanding how web applications work because they show how users' requests and the server's responses are communicated.

Imagine an example of an HTTP Request and an HTTP Response, where you can see key parts like the method, URL, headers, and status codes. These are what make the client-server interaction possible.

There are two types of HTTP messages:

HTTP Requests: Sent by the user to trigger actions on the web application.
HTTP Responses: Sent by the server in response to the user’s request.
Illustration showing a login POST request and a login successful response.

Each message follows a specific format that helps both the user and the server communicate smoothly.

Start Line

The start line is like the introduction of the message. It tells you what kind of message is being sent—whether it's a request from the user or a response from the server. This line also gives important details about how the message should be handled.

Headers

Headers are made up of key-value pairs that provide extra information about the HTTP message. They give instructions to both the client and the server handling the request or response. These headers cover all sorts of things, like security, content types, and more, making sure everything goes smoothly in the communication.

Empty Line

The empty line is a little divider that separates the header from the body. It’s essential because it shows where the headers stop and where the actual content of the message begins. Without this empty line, the message might get messed up, and the client or server could misinterpret it, causing errors.

Body

The body is where the actual data is stored. In a request, the body might include data the user wants to send to the server (like form data). In a response, it’s where the server puts the content that the user requested (like a webpage or API data).

Why Understanding HTTP Messages Matters
These messages are the foundation of how web applications communicate. If they’re structured properly, everything works smoothly.
Knowing how they work will help you diagnose issues in web communication, which means better performance and reliability for your web application.
It’s also crucial for security. Understanding HTTP messages helps you implement strong security measures to protect data during transmission. 

An HTTP request is what a user sends to a web server to interact with a web application and make something happen. Since these requests are often the first point of contact between the user and the web server, knowing how they work is super important—especially if you’re into cyber security.

Illustration showing a GET request and all of the different headers that are used.

Imagine an HTTP request showing the key parts like the method (e.g., GET or POST), path (e.g., /login), and version (e.g., HTTP/1.1). These elements make up the basics of how a client (user) communicates with a server.

Request Line
The request line (or start line) is the first part of an HTTP request and tells the server what kind of request it’s dealing with. It has three main parts: the HTTP method, the URL path, and the HTTP version.

Example: METHOD /path HTTP/version

HTTP Methods
The HTTP method tells the server what action the user wants to perform on the resource identified by the URL path. Here are some of the most common methods and their possible security issue:

GET
Used to fetch data from the server without making any changes. Reminder! Make sure you’re only exposing data the user is allowed to see. Avoid putting sensitive info like tokens or passwords in GET requests since they can show up as plaintext.

POST
Sends data to the server, usually to create or update something. Reminder! Always validate and clean the input to avoid attacks like SQL injection or XSS.

PUT
Replaces or updates something on the server. Reminder! Make sure the user is authorised to make changes before accepting the request.

PUT
Replaces or updates something on the server. Reminder! Make sure the user is authorised to make changes before accepting the request.

DELETE
Removes something from the server. Reminder! Just like with PUT, make sure only authorised users can delete resources.

Besides these common methods, there are a few others used in specific cases:

PATCH
Updates part of a resource. It’s useful for making small changes without replacing the whole thing, but always validate the data to avoid inconsistencies.

HEAD
Works like GET but only retrieves headers, not the full content. It’s handy for checking metadata without downloading the full response.

OPTIONS
Tells you what methods are available for a specific resource, helping clients understand what they can do with the server.

TRACE
Similar to OPTIONS, it shows which methods are allowed, often for debugging. Many servers disable it for security reasons.

CONNECT
Used to create a secure connection, like for HTTPS. It’s not as common but is critical for encrypted communication.

Each of these methods has its own set of security rules. For example, PATCH requests should be validated to avoid inconsistencies, and OPTIONS and TRACE should be turned off if not needed to avoid possible security risks.

URL Path
The URL path tells the server where to find the resource the user is asking for. For instance, in the URL https://tryhackme.com/api/users/123, the path /api/users/123 identifies a specific user.

Attackers often try to manipulate the URL path to exploit vulnerabilities, so it’s crucial to:

Validate the URL path to prevent unauthorised access
Sanitise the path to avoid injection attacks
Protect sensitive data by conducting privacy and risk assessments
Following these practices helps protect your web application from common attacks.

HTTP Version
The HTTP version shows the protocol version used to communicate between the client and server. Here’s a quick rundown of the most common ones:

HTTP/0.9 (1991)
The first version, only supported GET requests.

HTTP/1.0 (1996)
Added headers and better support for different types of content, improving caching.

HTTP/1.1 (1997)
Brought persistent connections, chunked transfer encoding, and better caching. It’s still widely used today.

HTTP/2 (2015)
Introduced features like multiplexing, header compression, and prioritisation for faster performance.

HTTP/3 (2022)
Built on HTTP/2, but uses a new protocol (QUIC) for quicker and more secure connections.

Although HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 offer better speed and security, many systems still use HTTP/1.1 because it’s well-supported and works with most existing setups. However, upgrading to HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 can provide significant performance and security improvements as more systems adopt them.

Removes something from the server. Reminder! Just like with PUT, make sure only authorised users can delete resources.
