# Service Scanning

The first thing we need to do is identify the operating system and any available services that might be running. 
A service is an application running on a computer that performs some useful function for other users or computers.
We call these specialized machines that host these useful services "servers" instead of workstations, 
allowing users to interact with and consume these various services. 

What we're interested in are services that have either been misconfigured or have a vulnerability. 
Instead of performing the actions expected as part of the service, we are interested to see if we can coerce the service into
performing some unintended action that supports our objectives, such as executing a command of our choosing.

Computers are assigned an IP address, which allows them to be uniquely identified and accessible on a network. 
The services running on these computers may be assigned a port number to make the service accessible. 
As discussed prior, port numbers range from 1 to 65,535, with the range of well-known ports 1 to 1,023 being reserved for privileged services.

### Port 0 is a reserved port in TCP/IP networking and is not used in TCP or UDP messages.

If anything attempts to bind to port 0 (such as a service), it will bind to the next available port above port 1,024 because port 0 is treated as a "wild card" port.

To access a service remotely, we need to connect using the correct IP address and port number and use a language that the service understands. 
Manually examining all of the 65,535 ports for any available services would be laborious, and so tools have been created to automate this process and scan the range of ports for us. 
One of the most commonly used scanning tools is Nmap(Network Mapper).

## Nmap
Let us start with the most basic scan. Suppose that we want to perform a basic scan against a target residing at 10.129.42.253. 
To do this we should type nmap 10.129.42.253 and hit return. We see that the Nmap scan was completed very quickly. 
This is because if we don't specify any additional options, Nmap will only scan the 1,000 most common ports by default. 
The scan output reveals that ports 21, 22, 80, 139, and 445 are available.

Under the PORT heading, it also tells us that these are TCP ports. 
By default, Nmap will conduct a TCP scan unless specifically requested to perform a UDP scan.
The STATE heading confirms that these ports are open. 
Sometimes we will see other ports listed that have a different state, such as filtered. 
This can happen if a firewall is only allowing access to the ports from specific addresses.
The SERVICE heading tells us the service's name is typically mapped to the specific port number. 
However, the default scan will not tell us what is listening on that port.
Until we instruct Nmap to interact with the service and attempt to tease out identifying information, it could be another service altogether.

As we gain familiarity, we will notice that several ports are commonly associated with Windows or Linux. 
For example, port 3389 is the default port for Remote Desktop Services and is an excellent indication that the target is a Windows machine.
In our current scenario, port 22 (SSH) being available indicates that the target is running Linux/Unix, but this service can also be configured on Windows. 
Let us run a more advanced Nmap scan and gather more information about the target device.

We can use the -sC parameter to specify that Nmap scripts should be used to try and obtain more detailed information. 
The -sV parameter instructs Nmap to perform a version scan. 
In this scan, Nmap will fingerprint services on the target system and identify the service protocol, application name, and version. 
The version scan is underpinned by a comprehensive database of over 1,000 service signatures. 
Finally, -p- tells Nmap that we want to scan all 65,535 TCP ports.

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 233.68 seconds
This returns a lot more information. We see that it took a lot longer to scan 65,535 ports than 1,000 ports. 
The -sC and -sV options also increase the duration of a scan, as instead of performing a simple TCP handshake, they perform a lot more checks. 
We notice that this time there is a VERSION heading, which reports the service version and the operating system if this is possible to identify.

So far, we know that the operating system is Ubuntu Linux. 
Application versions can also help reveal the target OS version. 
Take OpenSSH, for example. We see the reported version is OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.1. 
From inspection of other Ubuntu SSH package changelogs, we see the release version takes the format 1:7.3p1-1ubuntu0.1.

Updating our version to fit this format, we get 1:8.2p1-4ubuntu0.1. 
A quick search for this version online reveals that it is included in Ubuntu Linux Focal Fossa 20.04.

Google search results for '1:8.2p1-4ubuntu0.1 release' showing links to OpenSSH package on Launchpad.

Another quick search reveals that the release date of this OS is April 23rd, 2020.

Google search results for 'Ubuntu focal 20.04 release date' showing April 23, 2020, as the release date.

However, it is worth noting that this cross-referencing technique is not entirely reliable, as it is possible to install more recent application packages on an older OS version. 
The script scan -sC flag causes Nmap to report the server headers http-server-header page and the page title http-title for any web page hosted on the webserver. 
The web page title PHP 7.4.3 - phpinfo() indicates that this is a PHPInfo file, which is often manually created to confirm that PHP has been successfully installed. 
The title (and PHPInfo page) also reveals the PHP version, which is worth noting if it is vulnerable.

Nmap Scripts
Specifying -sC will run many useful default scripts against a target, but there are cases when running a specific script is required. 
For example, in an assessment scope, we may be asked to audit a large Citrix installation. We could use this Nmap script to audit for the severe Citrix NetScaler vulnerability (CVE-2019–19781), while Nmap also has other scripts to audit a Citrix installation.

/usr/share/nmap/scripts/citrix-enum-apps.nse
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/citrix-enum-servers-xml.nse
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/citrix-enum-servers.nse
The syntax for running an Nmap script is nmap --script <script name> -p<port> <host>.

Nmap scripts are a great way to enhance our scans' functionality, and inspection of the available options will pay dividends. 
Check out the Network Enumeration with Nmap module for a more detailed study of the Nmap tool.

Attacking Network Services
Banner Grabbing
As previously discussed, banner grabbing is a useful technique to fingerprint a service quickly. 
Often a service will look to identify itself by displaying a banner once a connection is initiated. 
Nmap will attempt to grab the banners if the syntax nmap -sV --script=banner <target> is specified.
We can also attempt this manually using Netcat. 
Let us take another example, using the nc version of Netcat:

  Service Scanning
RichMix@htb[/htb]$ nc -nv 10.129.42.253 21

(UNKNOWN) [10.129.42.253] 21 (ftp) open
220 (vsFTPd 3.0.3)
This reveals that the version of vsFTPd on the server is 3.0.3. 
We can also automate this process using Nmap's powerful scripting engine: nmap -sV --script=banner -p21 10.10.10.0/24.

## FTP
It is worth gaining familiarity with FTP, as it is a standard protocol, and this service can often contain interesting data.
A Nmap scan of the default port for FTP (21) reveals the vsftpd 3.0.3 installation that we identified previously. 
Further, it also reports that anonymous authentication is enabled and that a pub directory is available.

SMB
SMB (Server Message Block) is a prevalent protocol on Windows machines that provides many vectors for vertical and lateral movement. Sensitive data, including credentials, can be in network file shares, and some SMB versions may be vulnerable to RCE exploits such as EternalBlue. It is crucial to enumerate this sizeable potential attack surface carefully. Nmap has many scripts for enumerating SMB, such as smb-os-discovery.nse, which will interact with the SMB service to extract the reported operating system version.

In this case, the host runs a legacy Windows 7 OS, and we could conduct further enumeration to confirm if it is vulnerable to EternalBlue. The Metasploit Framework has several modules for EternalBlue that can be used to validate the vulnerability and exploit it, as we will see in a coming section. We can run a scan against our target for this module section to gather information from the SMB service. We can ascertain that the host runs a Linux kernel, Samba version 4.6.2, and the hostname is GS-SVCSCAN.

Shares
SMB allows users and administrators to share folders and make them accessible remotely by other users. Often these shares have files in them that contain sensitive information such as passwords. A tool that can enumerate and interact with SMB shares is smbclient. The -L flag specifies that we want to retrieve a list of available shares on the remote host, while -N suppresses the password prompt.

## SNMP
SNMP Community strings provide information and statistics about a router or device, helping us gain access to it. 
The manufacturer default community strings of public and private are often unchanged. 
In SNMP versions 1 and 2c, access is controlled using a plaintext community string, and if we know the name, we can gain access to it. 
Encryption and authentication were only added in SNMP version 3. Much information can be gained from SNMP. 
Examination of process parameters might reveal credentials passed on the command line, which might be possible to reuse for 
other externally accessible services given the prevalence of password reuse in enterprise environments.
Routing information, services bound to additional interfaces, and the version of installed software can also be revealed.
