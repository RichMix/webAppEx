Most modern web browsers come with built-in developer tools (DevTools), which are mainly intended for developers to test their web applications. 
  However, as web penetration testers, these tools can be a vital asset in any web assessment we perform, as a browser (and its DevTools) are among the assets we are most likely to have in every web assessment exercise. 
  In this module, we will also discuss how to utilize some of the basic browser devtools to assess and monitor different types of web requests.

Whenever we visit any website or access any web application, our browser sends multiple web requests and handles multiple HTTP responses to render the final view we see in the browser window. 
  To open the browser devtools in either Chrome or Firefox, we can click [CTRL+SHIFT+I] or simply click [F12]. The devtools contain multiple tabs, each of which has its own use. We will mostly be focusing on the Network tab in this module, as it is responsible for web requests.

If we click on the Network tab and refresh the page, we should be able to see the list of requests sent by the page: Network tab showing two GET requests to 188.166.146.97:31122. Status 304 for '/' and 404 for 'favicon.ico'.

As we can see, the devtools show us at a glance the response status (i.e. response code), the request method used (GET), the requested resource (i.e. URL/domain), along with the requested path. 
  Furthermore, we can use Filter URLs to search for a specific request, in case the website loads too many to go through.

Exercise: Try clicking on any of the requests to view their details. 
  You can then click on the Response tab to view the response body, and then click on the Raw button to view the raw (unrendered) source code of the response body.
