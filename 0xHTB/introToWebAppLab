Step	To-Do
1.	Set up a VM with a web server
2.	Create an HTML page
3.	Design it with CSS
4.	Add some simple functions with JavaScript
5.	Program a simple web application
6.	Connect your web application to the database
7.	Experiment with APIs
8.	Test your application for various vulnerabilities and security holes
9.	Try to adjust your code and configurations to close the vulnerabilities
Developing a small web application will provide a much deeper understanding of the structure and functionality. Learning how to set up and manage such a web server, the database's role, and how the individual pieces of code are linked together is an invaluable experience.

The Web Requests and JavaScript Deobfuscation Academy modules will help build on the knowledge presented in this module.

The module Hacking WordPress and other similar modules related to OWASP Top 10 (such as SQL Injection Fundamentals) are great next steps to get into penetration testing web applications and learn more about web application vulnerabilities and exploitation. Finally, to apply what we learned from these modules, we can jump into attacking some Easy boxes on HackTheBox.
